# Group collaboration

This document provides a description of how the group work went throughout the assignment and which
group member contributed to what.

The group collaboration worked fine throughout the assignment. The group did not delegate tasks but
worked together through active discussion. This way, both group members were able to contribute to
the project as a whole. We used pair-programming through parts of the project to achieve this.
